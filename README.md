# Hier stdlib
This is a standard library for [Hier programming language](https://github.com/wiktorwojcik112/hier).

# Usage
As hier doesn't have a package manager, all you need to use stdlib is place the repository (```git clone https://github.com/wiktorwojcik112/stdlib stdlib```) at the root of your program. Then you can import individual parts or entire stdlib by importing stdlib.hier file (```(@stdlib (import "stdlib/stdlib"))```).
